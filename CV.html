                    <p>Hey, this is my homepage, so I have to say something about myself. Sometimes it is hard to introduce yourself because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with. Let me give a try to see what kind of image you have about me through my self-description. I hope that my impression about myself and your impression about me are not so different. Here it goes. </p>

                        <p style="padding-right: 10%;">Being welcoming and extremely hospitable is a hallmark of Bangladeshi culture.  Visitors and friends are always welcome to drop in, sometimes even unannounced.  Open doors, sheer hospitality, and friendly disposition are an integral part of the society.  Add tons of mouthwatering food shared by the guests and host with chic-chat, laughter, love, and you have a complete picture of sociable Bangladeshis.

                            Naturally, I am very passionate about highlighting Bangladeshi cooking.  When I started to think about my guest post on Chef Dennis’s blog, Kachchi biryani appeared to be the perfect dish to share with all of you, as I would have prepared if I were to welcome each of you in a large group to my home over dinner.  Kachchi biryani is usually a featured dish for weddings and social gatherings and celebrations.  Layers of meat, rice and potatoes are infused with warm and delectable blends of aromatic spices to prepare kachchi biryani.  Whether it is a tender piece of mutton, potato, alubokhara(prune) or the rice itself, each spoonful is a mouthwatering surprise.  I find this grand biryani to have lesser prep time because all the ingredients are put in layers and then in the oven instead of cooking the rice and meat separately and then combining (leaving me with less pots to clean afterwards also).</p>

                            <p>Borhani, (Bengali: বোরহানী) is a traditional yogurt-like[1] drink from Bangladesh.[2] Borhani is made from sour doi, green chilli, mustard seeds, black salt, coriander and mint.[3] It is considered by some to be a type of lassi.[4] It is very commonly consumed in Dhaka and Chittagong regions of Bangladesh, where it is drunk in special events such as weddings and iftar gatherings in Ramadan. It is normally drank after heavy meals such as biryani (Kacchhi) and polao and morog Polao [5] in order to aid digestion although appetizer borhanis do exist</p>

                            <p>Coca-Cola, or Coke, is a carbonated soft drink manufactured by the Coca-Cola Company. Originally marketed as a temperance drink and intended as a patent medicine, it was invented in the late 19th century by John Stith Pemberton in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1888 Pemberton sold Coca-Cola's ownership rights to Asa Griggs Candler, a businessman, whose marketing tactics led Coca-Cola to its dominance of the global soft-drink market throughout the 20th and 21st century.[1] The drink's name refers to two of its original ingredients: coca leaves and kola nuts (a source of caffeine). The current formula of Coca-Cola remains a closely guarded trade secret; however, a variety of reported recipes and experimental recreations have been published. The secrecy around the formula has been used by Coca-Cola in its marketing as only a handful of anonymous employees know the formula.[2] The drink has inspired imitators and created a whole classification of soft drink: colas.
